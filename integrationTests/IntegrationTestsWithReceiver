Tested with receiver on 24/07/2015

Used the following setup-

Megatron used aftre upgrading the RAM and the Parallel port.
USername user
PWD 4vnu$er (i.e. avnuser)

1PPS connected from GPS rubidium to the ROACH Sync input
Power level injected through the Receiver at -87dBm, 6.782GHz

First check the wideband spectrometer mode...
python tut3_katadc carina 

Next switch to the narrowband mode.

python avnSpectrometerDisplayBroad.py -t 10 -a 50 -e -c 102 carina
-t 10 sets the level of ADC attenuation (5 dB)
-a 50 sets the number of snaps to integrate (about 130 ms worth)
-e plots the adjacent channels on the same scales
-c 102 selects the 102nd coarse channel for the centre fine FFT, 160 MHz lies here

Discovered that the frequency setting was wrong on the Valon - was outputing 168MHz clock speed?
Rebooted the roach and power cycled the Valon and it went back to correct setting- Still red LED on the fron though?
